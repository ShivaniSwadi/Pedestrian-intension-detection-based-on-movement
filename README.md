# Pedestrian-intension-detection-based-on-movement

## Problem statement
Design and develop an algorithm fpr pedestrian intension detection based on motion tracking.
           Autonomous vehicles are expected to reduce drivers’ workload and  reduce the number of traffic accidents caused by human error.
One of the most significant challenges that autonomous vehicles still confront is a lack of comprehensive understanding of human behavior.

Behaviour prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving  applications as it supports efficient decision making and enables risk  assessment.
The function of an autonomous vehicle to predict the future states of the  nearby pedestrians based on the current and past observations of the  surrounding environment, helps enhance their awareness of the imminent  hazards.

## System Design

Our research aims to provide autonomous vehicles with the ability to predict the intended actions of pedestrians in real time using only a video stream from a monocular RGB camera. In order to achieve this, a unified framework that can recognise and track pedestrians in traffic situations utilising a moving observer RGB camera. Furthermore, by using a real-time spatio-temporal model,  method predicts the pedestrian's intended course of action based on the sequence of observed bounding boxes.

The complete system is designed into three main steps:
* Pedestrian Detection using YOLOv3 algorithm
* Pedestrian Tracking using Deep SORT algorithm
* Pedestrian Classification using Spatio-temporal densnet.
